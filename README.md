Ever wondered how we can send data using light? In this project, I used a laser module and an LDR to transmit data in binary (zeros and ones) and translate it into letters! 📡💡

🔍 How it Works:
1. The laser module sends pulses of light to represent binary data.
2. The LDR detects the light and converts it back into electrical signals.
3. Finally, we decode the signals into readable text!

💡 Why It’s Cool:
This project demonstrates the principles of optical communication and is a fun way to explore the intersection of electronics and coding!

This is a very basic project using only Arduino Uno, laser module and LDR.
This project is not practical in real life because both modules are connected to the same arduino but it demonstrate the principles of using laser as a communication method.
